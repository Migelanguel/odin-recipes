        <h3>A quesillo is a popular Latin American, particularly Venezuelan, 
            caramel custard dessert similar to flan, made with eggs, sweetened 
            condensed milk, whole milk, sugar, and vanilla, famous for its airy 
            texture with small holes, resembling a "little cheese"</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare a bain-marie, or water bath, by filling a 9-inch 
                heat-proof container with water.</li>
            <li>Melt sugar in a nonstick pan over medium-low heat, stirring 
                constantly until melted, 7 to 10 minutes; be careful to 
                keep it from burning. Pour sugar into a flan mold, coating 
                the sides to ensure that the egg/milk mixture in the next 
                step will not touch the container.</li>
            <li>Pour sweetened condensed milk into a bowl. Fill the empty can 
                with milk and add to the bowl; stir in eggs and vanilla extract. 
                Blend well. Fold mixture with a spatula or tap against the 
                counter to remove air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Pour milk mixture into the slightly cooled flan mold. Put the 
                lid on and place inside the water bath; don't let the water 
                go over the rim.</li>
            <li>Bake the quesillo in the bain-marie in the preheated oven for 
                45 minutes. Pry lid open with a knife carefully; continue 
                baking until set, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Let quesillo cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes; 
                refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Slide a knife around the 
                edges of the mold to loosen and invert onto a plate.</li>
        </ol>
