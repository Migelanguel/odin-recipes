        <li>10 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. 
            Drain, rinse with cool water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet or stockpot. Add  
            onions and garlic, and cook over low-medium heat until soft 
            and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and cook, 
            stirring, until meat is well-browned.</li>
        <li>Add stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, bay leaf, 
            sugar, and red wine or stock. Simmer over very low heat until 
            sauce thickens and develops a rich flavor, about 30 to 45 minutes. 
            Taste for seasoning, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>While the red sauce is simmering, prepare the béchamel sauce: Place 
            the butter in a heavy saucepan, and melt it over medium-low heat. 
            Whisk in the flour, and cook until butter/flour mixture is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Whisk the milk into the butter/flour mixture, and cook over medium heat, 
            stirring constantly, until sauce thickens. Add salt, nutmeg (optional) 
            and Parmesan cheese, and stir until smooth. Taste for seasoning, and 
            season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch 
            baking pan. Cover with a layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cover the noodles with a layer of one-third of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Top meat sauce with another layer of noodles. Spread another, thicker 
            layer of béchamel sauce (about 1 cup) on top of the noodles then 
            sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese and a couple of tablespoons of 
            Parmesan cheese over the béchamel.</li>
        <li>Repeat with another meat sauce layer then another béchamel and cheese 
            layer. Repeat with one more meat sauce layer; top with a final layer of 
            noodles then spread the remaining béchamel over the noodles, and 
            sprinkle remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with a piece of foil and bake, covered, for 30 minutes. 
            Remove foil, and continue to bake until cheese is melted and lasagna is 
            heated through and bubbly. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
