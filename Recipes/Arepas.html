        <h3>Arepas are versatile, round, unleavened patties made from ground 
            maize dough, a staple food in Venezuela and Colombia, often 
            served plain, as a side, or sliced and stuffed like a sandwich 
            with various savory fillings</h3>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually 
                stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms 
                a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
            <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball 
                to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in 
                batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
                Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain 
                until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin 
                serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        </ol>
